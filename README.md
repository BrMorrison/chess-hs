## Chess-hs: A simple chess game in Haskell

I created this as a learning project to get more familiar with Haskell and decision-making algorithms.

### Features
 * A terminal-based chess program
 * An AI that can make moves for you when you don't want to play.

### Missing Features
 * Castling
 * Selectable pawn promotion
 * En-passant
 * Enforcement of various stalemate rules
 * Probably more
